# Theme gallery

On this page you can find a list of all built-in themes. 
These themes can also provide a good starting point for [creating a custom theme](docs/tutorials/styling-and-themes). 


:::warning

These themes are still in work and _might_ change a bit in the upcoming releases. 

At the same time, suggestions and feedback are welcome and can be posted in the [theme discussion category](https://github.com/orgs/lilaq-project/discussions/categories/themes).

## Usage

All built-in themes can be found in the module `lq.theme`. A theme can be applied through a `show` rule:
```typ
#show: lq.theme.skyline
#lq.diagram(
  ..
)
```
To some extent, themes can be composed because they usually only override a few settings. 

## Themes 

<LilaqTheme>
Although the default setting is not available as an actual theme (it would just be empty), we show it here for comparison.  
```typ render
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>


<LilaqTheme name="misty">
```typ render
#show: lq.theme.misty
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>


<LilaqTheme name="ocean">
```typ render
#show: lq.theme.ocean
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>


<LilaqTheme name="skyline">
```typ render
#show: lq.theme.skyline
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>


<LilaqTheme name="schoolbook">
```typ render
#show: lq.theme.schoolbook
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>


<LilaqTheme name="moon">
A good prototype for a dark theme. Requires a dark background and light text color. 
```typ render
#set text(white)
#show lq.selector(lq.diagram): box.with(fill: rgb("#242424"), inset: 1em)
#show: lq.theme.moon
#include "src/typst/_demonstrate-theme.typ"
```
</LilaqTheme>
