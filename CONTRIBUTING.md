## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Repository

1. Clone the repository recursively:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lilaq-project/lilaq-project.github.io.git --recursive
   cd lilaq-project.github.io
   ```
2. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
   - Node.js
   - Python (version 3.8 or higher)
   - Typst (latest version)

3. Install the required Node.js dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Previewing Changes Locally

To preview your changes locally, follow these steps:

1. Generate a set of Typst images by calling:
   ```sh
   npm run generate-images
   ```

2. Generate the documentation reference from the Tyst source files:
   ```sh
   npm run generate-docs
   ```

3. Start the local development server:
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) to view the documentation.

Make sure to verify that your changes render correctly and do not introduce any errors.

## Testing

Before submitting a PR, ensure your changes render correctly and do not introduce errors. 

All contributions must pass the test deployment before being merged. This is automatically checked when submitting a PR. You can check locally whether the build passes by running `npm run build`. 


## Documentation Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:
- **Clarity**: Write clear and concise explanations. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and provide definitions for technical terms.
- **Structure**: Organize content logically. Use headings, lists, and tables where appropriate.
- **Examples**: Include examples to illustrate concepts. Ensure examples are accurate and relevant. Automatically evaluated Typst examples can be created through code blocks with the language `example`. 
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology, formatting, and tone throughout the documentation.
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal references and ensure all links are functional.

---

## Code Style

To maintain consistency across the documentation:
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown syntax correctly and consistently.
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 80 characters where possible to improve readability.
- **Headings**: Use proper heading levels (`##`, `###`, etc.) to structure content.
- **Lists**: Use `-` for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Code Blocks**: Use fenced code blocks (```` ``` ````) with the appropriate language identifier for syntax highlighting.
