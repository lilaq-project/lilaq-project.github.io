# Lilac documentation
_Data visualization in Typst_


## Installation
Lilac can be imported via
```typ
#import "@preview/lilac:0.1.0" as lc
```
This way, the Typst compiler automatically downloads and installs the package. 
You can also download Lilac manually from the [repository](https://github.com/lilac-plot/lilac) and import a local version. 


## Study

We have a [**quick-start guide**](./quickstart.md) available for you to immediately get your hands dirty.
