In this tutorial you will learn how to use Lilaq for creating basic diagrams and plots. 

We will start by importing Lilaq. 
```typ
#import "@preview/lilaq:0.1.0" as lc
```
```typ example  
#import lilaq
```
```typ
#import lilaq
```

## Getting started

In order to create a new visualization, we use [`diagram`](./foundations/diagram.mdx). This function can take an arbitrary number of plot objects that are generated by the various [plot functions](./category/plot-types). For this example, we use [`plot`](./plot-types/plot) to make a 2D line plot from arrays of $x$ and $y$ values. 

```typ example
#lc.diagram(
    lc.plot((0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 2, 1, 2))
)
```
Pretty easy. Let's add another plot and some labels!
```typ example
#let xs = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

#lc.diagram(
    title: [Precious data],
    xlabel: $x$, 
    ylabel: $y$,

    lc.plot(xs, (5, 4, 2, 1, 2), color: red, label: [Red data]),
    lc.plot(xs, (2, 5, 4, 2, 3), color: blue, label: [Blue data])
)
```
Note, that a legend automatically appears when the plots are labelled. Only labelled plots are listed. You can read up in the [Legend Tutorial](./tutorials/legend.md) on how to configure and customize legends. 


## Anatomy of a diagram

A diagram consists of plots, axes, ticks, labels, legends and more. Click on any annotation to find out more about configuration and customization. 

import Anatomy from '@site/src/components/Anatomy';

<Anatomy />

## Ticks

Lilaq tries to automatically find a good distance and distribution for axis ticks. However, in some cases the algorithm might produce suboptimal results or a specific configuration is required. 

There are different level of tick customization, ascending both in power and complexity
- [options like `tick-distance`](#tick-distance)
- [manual tick positions](#manual-tick-positions)
- custom tick locators

### Tick-distance
### Manual tick positions
### Custom tick locators

Lilaq comes with a few automatic tick locators, dedicated to finding appropriate tick locations e.g. for linear or logarithmic plotting. Depending on the setting of <Crossref target="diagram#xscale" /> and <Crossref target="diagram#yscale" />. However, it is also possible to write a tick locator
