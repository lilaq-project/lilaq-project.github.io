In this tutorial you will learn how to use Lilaq for creating basic diagrams and plots. 

We will start by importing Lilaq. 
```typ
#import lilaq
```

## Getting started

In order to create a new visualization, we use [`diagram`](./reference/diagram). This function can take an arbitrary number of plot objects that are generated by the various [plot functions](./plot-types). For this example, we use [`plot`](./reference/plot) to make a 2D line plot from arrays of $x$ and $y$ values. 

```typ example
#lq.diagram(
  lq.plot((0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 2, 1, 2))
)
```
Pretty easy. Let's add another plot and some labels!
```typ example
#let xs = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

#lq.diagram(
  title: [Precious data],
  xlabel: $x$, 
  ylabel: $y$,

  lq.plot(xs, (5, 4, 2, 1, 2), mark: "s", label: [A]),
  lq.plot(xs, (2, 5, 4, 2, 3), mark: "o", label: [B])
)
```
Note, that a legend automatically appears when the plots are labelled. Only labelled plots are listed. You can read up in the [Legend Tutorial](./tutorials/legend.md) on how to configure and customize legends. 


## Anatomy of a diagram

A diagram consists of plots, axes, ticks, labels, legends and more. Click on any annotation to find out more about configuration and customization. 

import Anatomy from '@site/src/components/Anatomy';

<Anatomy />

## Ticks

Lilaq tries to automatically find a good distance and distribution for axis ticks. However, in some cases the algorithm might produce suboptimal results or a specific configuration is required. 

There are different level of tick customization, ascending both in power and complexity
- [options like `tick-distance`](#tick-distance)
- [manual tick positions](#manual-tick-positions)
- custom tick locators

### Tick-distance
### Manual tick positions
### Custom tick locators

Lilaq comes with a few automatic tick locators, dedicated to finding appropriate tick locations e.g. for linear or logarithmic plotting. Depending on the setting of <Crossref target="diagram#xscale" /> and <Crossref target="diagram#yscale" />. However, it is also possible to write a tick locator
