# Plot data from a CSV file

It is quite easy to load a csv file and plot its contents. Let us assume we have some data given as two columns of a CSV file. 

import DataCSVSource from '!!raw-loader!./data.csv';

<CodeBlock title="data.csv">{DataCSVSource}</CodeBlock>

We now load this file via the built-in [`csv`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/csv/) function. We need to deal with two problems:
- The `csv` function returns the data as an array of rows (being arrays themselves). However, we want to plot the columns âˆ’ therefore the data needs to be transposed. 
- The individual numeric values are parsed as strings. We need to convert them to `float` before plotting. 

Both points are addressed in a little helper function `load-csv-data()`. 

```typ example title=plot-example
>>> #let csv = p => csv("docs/examples/" + p)
#import lilaq

#let load-csv-data(filename) = {
  let cols = array.zip(..csv(filename)) 
  return cols.map(col => col.map(float))
}

#let (x, y) = load-csv-data("data.csv")

#lc.diagram(
  lc.plot(x, y, label:"asd"),
)
```
