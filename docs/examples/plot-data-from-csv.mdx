# Plot data from a CSV file

It is quite easy to load a csv file and plot its contents. Let us assume we have some data given as two columns of a CSV file. 

import DataCSVSource from '!!raw-loader!./data.csv';

<CodeBlock title="data.csv">{DataCSVSource}</CodeBlock>

We could load this file via the built-in [`csv`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/csv/) function. However, wes need to deal with two problems:
- The `csv` function returns the data as an array of rows (being arrays themselves). However, we want to plot the columns âˆ’ therefore the data needs to be transposed. 
- The individual numeric values are parsed as strings. We need to convert them to `float` before plotting. 

Both points are addressed with the function <Crossref target="lq.load-txt" /> provided by Lilaq. 

```example
>>> #let read = p => read("docs/examples/" + p)
#import lilaq

#let (x, y) = lq.load-txt(read("data.csv"))

#lq.diagram(
  lq.plot(x, y),
)
```
